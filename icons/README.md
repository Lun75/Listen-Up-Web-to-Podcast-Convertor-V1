# Icons

Place your extension icons here:
- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create icons using tools like:
- [Figma](https://figma.com)
- [Canva](https://canva.com)
- [GIMP](https://gimp.org)

For now, the extension will work without icons, but you should add them before publishing.
